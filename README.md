## Introduction
This dashboard presents an analysis of bike sales, focusing on customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and commute patterns. The primary goal is to uncover trends and insights regarding income per purchase, customer age brackets, and commute distance to better inform sales strategies.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯
The analysis aims to answer the following key questions:

+ What is the average income per purchase based on gender and purchase status (whether the customer made a purchase or not)?
+ How do customer age brackets correlate with purchase decisions?
+ How does customer commute distance relate to purchase behavior?
+ How do factors like marital status, region, and education level affect purchasing trends?


## Data Preparation
Several visualizations were developed to represent the data:

+ __Average Income per Purchase (by Gender and Purchase Status):__ This bar chart compares the average income of customers who purchased bikes (Yes) and those who didnâ€™t (No) across gender lines, providing insights into spending behavior.

+ __Customer Age Brackets:__ The line chart illustrates the distribution of customers across age groups, comparing those who made purchases (Yes) versus those who did not (No).

+ __Customer Commute Analysis:__ This line chart tracks how the distance customers commute relates to their likelihood of making a purchase, comparing purchasing (Yes) versus non-purchasing (No) customers.


## Pivot Tables
Several pivot tables were created to summarize key aspects of the data:

+ __Average Income by Gender and Purchase Status:__ This pivot table shows the average income for both genders, split by whether customers made a purchase (Yes) or not (No), helping identify income trends.

+ __Customer Age Brackets by Purchase Status:__ It groups customers into age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, Old) and compares those who purchased (Yes) versus those who didnâ€™t (No).

+ __Commute Distance by Purchase Status:__ This table summarizes customer commute distances and their purchasing status, revealing patterns based on proximity to the store.

+ __Demographics (Marital Status, Region, Education):__ Pivot tables were used to examine how these factors influence purchasing behavior.

These pivot tables enabled efficient data segmentation and helped uncover critical insights on customer behavior.


## Dashboard Visualizations
Several visualizations were developed to represent the data:

+ __Average Income per Purchase (by Gender and Purchase Status):__ This bar chart compares the average income of customers who purchased bikes (Yes) and those who didnâ€™t (No) across gender lines, providing insights into spending behavior.

+ __Customer Age Brackets:__ The line chart illustrates the distribution of customers across age groups, comparing those who made purchases (Yes) versus those who did not (No).

+ __Customer Commute Analysis:__ This line chart tracks how the distance customers commute relates to their likelihood of making a purchase, comparing purchasing (Yes) versus non-purchasing (No) customers.


## Insights from the Dashboard
The following key insights are revealed through the dashboard:

+ __Income and Gender:__ Males show a higher average income per purchase than females, with those who made purchases (Yes) having noticeably higher incomes than those who did not (No). This suggests that male customers, especially those who are buyers, are a valuable target group for higher-end sales.

+ __Customer Age Brackets:__ Middle-aged customers are the largest group to make purchases (Yes), indicating a key demographic for marketing and product targeting.
+ __Commute Trends:__ Customers who commute 0-5 miles are more likely to make a purchase compared to those who commute longer distances. However, for those commuting over 5 miles, the likelihood of purchasing (Yes) remains relatively stable, implying the store may benefit from marketing to local and nearby regions.


## Conclusion
The dashboard highlights important purchasing behaviors based on income, gender, age, and commute distance. Middle-aged, higher-income males, particularly those living within 5 miles, emerge as the key target demographic for sales and marketing efforts. Additionally, focusing on local customers may yield more immediate results, with potential for outreach to those slightly beyond. By visualizing these insights, the dashboard serves as a powerful tool for driving data-informed sales strategies and customer outreach efforts.
